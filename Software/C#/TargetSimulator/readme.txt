The target simulator is created to simulate the arduino sending shot commands over a serial port (USB).
In order to simulate the conection between 2 ports, a virtual null-modem cable software is to be used : i recomend com0com from http://com0com.sourceforge.net/. At installation, choose to setup 2 paired COM ports.

After install, connect the TargetSimulator to one COM, and freETarget software to the other and than use the buttons in the simulator to send shot commands.
