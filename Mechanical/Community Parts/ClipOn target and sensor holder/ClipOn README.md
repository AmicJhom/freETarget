# Clip-on Target and Sensor holder

These group of STL files makes it easy to position the target paper perfectly relative to the sensors. The target-holder can be clipped on the sensor holders and holds the paper very close to the sensors, which is ideal for correct detection. All the parts are small enough to be printed on a cheap small 3D printer.

Print in PLA:
4 x sensorholder
1 x target holder bottom
1 x target holder left
1 x target holder right

Then mount the sensors on the holders, after that clip everything together. To make the three target holder pieces to fit snugly, you may have to use some sandpaper.
